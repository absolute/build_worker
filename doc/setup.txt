a_string.should be_empty #When using a be_something matcher, RSpec removes the “be_”, appends a “?” and calls the resulting method in the receiver a_string.empty?

a_collection.should have(10).items #items is just providing some meaning to the expectation
“lucas”.should have(5).characters  #Strings are not collections by definition but they respond to a lot of methods that collections do, like length() and size(). This allow us to use have() to expect a string of a specific length.
